# GPS-Audiogame
Game template for GPS located audio-file-hunt. Made in Unity


This is an attempt of creating an application for mobile devices with unity written in C#, which lets the players walk around a certain locataion,
discover audio files, which then lead them to other locations with next audio files.
Imagine a game, where one character tells you to go to place A, there you discover, you have to go to place B or C.
Regarding your decision, the next place (place D) will have different encounters.

I wrote it, because already existing GPS services did not meet the "game" requirements, like enabling and disabling story parts
after hearing them once.
